          The Computer Science Club at Harper College is a student-led organization dedicated to exploring technology, coding, and innovation.
          We provide a collaborative space for students interested in programming, cybersecurity, data science, game development, and emerging tech fields.
          Our mission is to build technical skills, foster teamwork, and connect members with industry professionals and campus resources.
          We host projects, guest talks, and peer-to-peer tutoring to help members apply what they learn in class to real-world challenges.
          Whether you're a beginner learning your first language or an experienced developer looking to share knowledge, the CS Club welcomes you. Join us to code, collaborate, and create together.

          We use Discord as our main communication hub.
          Members discuss coding topics, share resources, and collaborate on ongoing projects.
          Itâ€™s also where we plan events, organize meetings, and handle club operations such as voting and decision-making.
